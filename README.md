This is a place to show off the work we do in class. Currently it's hosting WIP's but eventually it will be hosting well polished projects.

## Future plans

* Plan to condense sample and test projects into one repository and remove from view (you don't really need to see me testing columns I don't think.)
* Plan to polish a select few websites and blogs, expand their content, and add features
* Plan to apply Bootstrap styling to past projects.
