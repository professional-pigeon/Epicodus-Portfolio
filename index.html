      <h3>Project Forward</h3>
        <p>Hello, thank you for checking out my projects. This is a place for me to put my class projects and eventually personal projects. These are items I work on individually for a full day on Friday to demonstrate an understanding of concepts learned the 4 days before. They will escalate in complexity and I plan to continue updating them as makes sense.</p>
      <h3>Projects week 1</h3>
        <p>You are looking at it! Week 1 was HTML and css. This is portfolio page is the result of that.</p>
        <br>       
      <h3>Projects week 2</h4>
        <p>This week's project was an understanding of branching and an introduction to javascript. This page is a coding language selector that branches to 8 different languages and has a randomizer.</p>

      <h3>Projects week 3</h3>
        <p>This weeks project is a test of loops and arrays. Using loops and arrays we turn a number into a range and replace numbers in that range based on certain rules.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>College</li>
        <p><strong>Illinois State University:</strong> Bachelors of Sciences Psychology</p>
        <li>
          <h4>Job experience</h4>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Operations Coordinator at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Oregon and SW Washington from <em>July 2018 - May 2021</em></li>
          <p>At RMHC I was in charge of maintaining the buildings, contractors, vendors and their contracts, and managed projects for additions, improvemenets, and restoration. A joy of a job and a healthy experience.</p>
          <li>Bar Manager and Show Booker at Local Celebrity from <em>June 2017 - Jan 2018</em></li>
          <p>My best friend and I opened this bar together. We had been doing a live music video podcast together and wanted to transition that experience to a music venue. I learned how to bartend and run a bartending staff and kitchen, as well as did regular show booking and promotion. Lot of work, but yet again, a joy. Did you know you need dance insurance for music venues? I do.</p>

        In a pre-covid world I was a social being. I enjoy <span class="highlight1">biking</span>, <span class="highlight2">D&D</span>, <span class="highlight3">attending shows and playing music</span>, and video games. I am passionate about environmental concerns and the overlap between economic and social justice. I value my ability to work within the learn/test/edit cycle in my work and I'm not particularly discouraged by scope, failure, or criticism. I'm not beyond anxiety, and I'm not a beacon of joy every day of my life, but I do try to treat people kindly even when I'm not in a great place. Those skills have allowed me to be successful personally and professionally the last few years of my life.
