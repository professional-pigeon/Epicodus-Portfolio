      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>College</li>
          <p><strong>Illinois State University:</strong> Bachelors of Sciences Psychology</p>
        <li><h4>Job experience</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Operations Coordinator at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Oregon and SW Washington from <em>July 2018 - May 2021</em></li>
          <p>At RMHC I was in charge of maintaining the buildings, contractors, vendors and their contracts, and managed projects for additions, improvemenets, and restoration. A joy of a job and a healthy experience.</p>
          <li>Bar Manager and Show Booker at Local Celebrity from <em>June 2017 - Jan 2018</em></li>
          <p>My best friend and I opened this bar together. We had been doing a live music video podcast together and wanted to transition that experience to a music venue. I learned how to bartend and run a bartending staff and kitchen, as well as did regular show booking and promotion. Lot of work, but yet again, a joy. Did you know you need dance insurance for music venues? I do.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies, Interests, and Skills</h3>
        <p><img class="floatleft" src="img/guitar.jpeg" alt="A photo of a guitar"><img class="floatright" src="img/bike.jpeg" alt="A photo of a bike">In a pre-covid world I was a social being. I enjoy <span class="highlight1">biking</span>, <span class="highlight2">D&D</span>, <span class="highlight3">attending shows and playing music</span>, and video games. I am passionate about environmental concerns and the overlap between economic and social justice. I value my ability to work within the learn/test/edit cycle in my work and I'm not particularly discouraged by scope, failure, or criticism. I'm not beyond anxiety, and I'm not a beacon of joy every day of my life, but I do try to treat people kindly even when I'm not in a great place. Those skills have allowed me to be successful personally and professionally the last few years of my life.</p>
