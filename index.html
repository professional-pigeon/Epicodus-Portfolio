  <h3>Projects from my first week</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>My first webpage</li>
      <p>An HTML, CSS, and Markdown project: This is an interesting one. Technically these are webpages made with Sho Newman as a joint affair but this was before we learned joint commits. I later expanded upon these in future lessons</p>
    <li>Boring blog</li>
      An HTML and CSS project: As for as lessons and understanding in a week of coding, I really came into my own with CSS here. I had spent a morning learning it and my reach goal was creating quarter circles that interacted with the page correctly. My partner and I spent a good chunk of time understanding boxes.
        <li>additional reading</li>
        <p>Also spent a good chunk of time learning about the difference between CMYK and RGB differences in webpage presentation. I have a book of color theory that let's you compile and coordinate, it is in CYMK... that does not translate perfectly to hexdecimal as your screen uses RGB.</p>
    <li>Boring lecture</li>
      <p>An HTML and CSS project: "Water Wet: Why?" was pretty popular with my pair partner that day. I later retitled it to "Water Wet: An Odyssey" when I realized I answered none of the questions.</p>
    <li>Introductory HTML projects from the first day of class (in order of creation)</li>
      <ol>Icebreaker</ol>
      <ol>Hello world</ol>
      <ol>goodbye cruel world</ol>
    <li>Mardown project: Vegan food blog</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>College</li>
      <p>Illinois State University: Bachelors of Psychology</p>
    <li>Job experience</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Operations Coordinator at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Oregon and SW Washington from July 2018 - May 2021</li>
        <p>At RMHC I was in charge of maintaining the buildings, contractors, vendors and their contracts, and managed projects for additions, improvemenets, and restoration. A joy of a job and a healthy experience.</p>
        <li>Bar Manager and Show Booker at Local Celebrity</li>
        <p>My best friend and I opened this bar together (with his money). We had been doing a music podcast on video together and wanted to transition that experience to a music venue.</p>
